## Motivation

* The Dataset which I was taken is based on the details of the various company which offers the salaries based on the positions in IT  in different locations. I have taken these data form the source called Kaggle it is an online website where we can find multiple numbers of the datasets. Kaggle is a subsidiary of Google LLC. The data which I have taken consist of 22774 * ROWS and 6 * COLUMN. In which I am planning to take 254 * ROWS and 4  * COLUMN by sorting out based on the high pay on each role. This dataset was contributed by 
'SOURAV BANERJEE' , and it was last updated 4 months ago.
* [Salary, location, Employment status , job role] using the list we can implement the data for each role. We can also implement distinct salary and the roles using dictionary, where role is the key , salary is the value. 
* We can also get the data by city where the respective roles are being paid high. Where city is key and list as a value where the list consist of role and salary
